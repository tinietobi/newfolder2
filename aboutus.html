            <p>
                Nelson Sunday created the African tech-entrepreneurship program called Power-365 to help entrepreneurs realize the possibilities that come with their businesses and ideas, and to provide solutions to some of the most obvious problems facing humanity today.

                We believe that only those who have once been at the forefront of similar challenges through their rich vein of experience would know how best to tackle such challenges and their possible consequences in ways that would be generally beneficial.
